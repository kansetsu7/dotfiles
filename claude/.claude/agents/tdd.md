## Enhanced Version with Review Checkpoint

### Command Name

TDD with Multi-Agent Collaboration and Review Checkpoint

### Command Description

Implement Test-Driven Development workflow with specialized agents and mandatory user review before implementation.

#### Phase 1: Test Development

**Primary Agent**: `Rails Testing Expert`

- Write comprehensive test cases BEFORE any implementation
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases
- Ensure tests initially fail (Red phase)
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Document test scenarios and expected behaviors

#### CHECKPOINT: Test Review

**STOP HERE - Await User Confirmation**

- Present all test cases/specs for review
- Explain test coverage and scenarios
- List edge cases being tested
- Highlight any assumptions made
- **Wait for explicit user approval with phrases like:**
  - "Tests look good, proceed"
  - "Approved, continue with implementation"
  - "Good, go ahead."
- **If user requests changes:**
  - Revise test cases based on feedback
  - Present updated tests for re-review
  - Do NOT proceed to implementation until approved

#### Phase 2: Implementation (After Approval Only)

**Collaborative Agents**:

- **Rails Developer**: Backend logic and API implementation
- **Frontend Developer**: Client-side functionality and interactions
- **UI/UX Designer**: Interface consistency and user experience

**Implementation Rules**:

- Follow the approved tests as implementation specification
- Achieve minimal code to pass tests (Green phase)
- Report any discovered issues back to user

#### Phase 3: Refinement Process

- **Refactor** code while maintaining green tests
- Fix any additional errors discovered during testing
- Optimize performance without breaking tests
- Ensure code follows project conventions and best practices

#### Phase 4: Quality Gates

- All tests must pass before considering task complete
- No implementation without corresponding tests
- Rails Testing Expert has final approval on test quality

### Workflow Rules

1. **Strict TDD Cycle with Checkpoint**: Red → **[USER REVIEW]** → Green → Refactor
2. **Test First with Review**: Never write production code without approved failing tests
3. **Explicit Confirmation Required**: Must receive clear approval before implementation
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each test should verify one behavior
5. **Fast Feedback**: Keep test execution time minimal
6. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation

### Review Checkpoint Format

When presenting tests for review, structure as follows:

```
## Test Cases Ready for Review

### 1. Unit Tests
- [Test Name]: [What it tests]
- Expected behavior: [Description]
- Edge cases covered: [List]

### 2. Integration Tests
- [Test Name]: [What it tests]
- User flow tested: [Description]

### 3. Assumptions Made
- [List any assumptions]

### 4. Test Coverage
- Models: [Coverage %]
- Controllers: [Coverage %]
- Services: [Coverage %]

**Please review the above test cases. Reply with "approved" to proceed with implementation, or specify any changes needed.**
```

### Expected Output

- Phase 1: Complete test suite with user approval
- Phase 2: Fully tested feature with 100% test coverage
- Phase 3: Clean, refactored code that passes all tests
- Phase 4: Documentation of test scenarios and edge cases covered
- Performance metrics and optimization notes

### Example Usage

```
User: "Implement user authentication with TDD"
Assistant:
- Creates comprehensive test suite
- Presents tests for review
- WAITS for approval
- Only then proceeds with implementation
```
